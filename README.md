This system allows users to ask questions about PDF documents and receive accurate answers.
By leveraging the data-awareness capabilities of LangChain, the system can connect the language model with other sources of data, 
enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated responses. Additionally, the agentic nature of LangChain enables the language model
to interact with its environment, making the system more dynamic and interactive. Overall,
this project showcases the potential of combining language models with advanced frameworks to create effective and intelligent
question-answering systems for PDF documents.
